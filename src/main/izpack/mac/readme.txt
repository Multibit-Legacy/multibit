MultiBit 0.5.6beta is a test version of MultiBit that supports
encrypted wallets. Please try it out cautiously.

1) It is recommended you keep your encrypted wallets in a separate
   directory so that you can keep track of them.

2) MultiBit 0.5.6beta opens in 'portable mode'. It has its own 
   startup file (multibit.properties) so that it does not open 
   your 'real' MultiBit wallets.

3) Let me know if you have any problems.
