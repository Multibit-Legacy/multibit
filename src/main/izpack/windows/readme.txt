MultiBit 0.5.1alpha is a test version of MultiBit that supports
encrypted wallets. Please try it out cautiously.

This is NOT production code yet so please read the following notes:

1) The encryption algorithm used in 0.5.1alpha HAS CHANGED from
   0.5.0alpha.

   For your MultiBit 0.5.0alpha encrypted wallets:

   + Open them in 0.5.0alpha and do a File | Remove Password.
   + Close 0.5.0alpha.
   + Open them in 0.5.1alpha. You can then re-encrypt them.


2) It is recommended you keep your encrypted wallets in a separate
   directory so that you can keep track of them.


3) MultiBit 0.5.1alpha opens in 'portable mode'. It has its own 
   startup file (multibit.properties) so that it does not open 
   your 'real' MultiBit wallets.


4) Let me know if you have any problems.
