TODO from 0.1.3rc1 testing
--------------------------
Testers:
+ Nick Simpson, Windows 7 Ultimate x64.
+ Nibor, Unspecified Windows.
+ Mats Henricson, Linux/ Ubuntu
+ Jim Burton, Mac OSX.


Needs fixing prior to general release.

Start up
+ Bat file fails when Java not on path. (Nick).
  Will modify bat file to check JAVA_HOME.
+ Console is confusing on Send (Mats)
  Will modify bat file to use javaw to hide console.

Spend
o Spend of 0 BTC not checked. (Nick).
  Have added tests for missing, non-parsable, negative or zero amount.
+ Problems on spend (Mats).
  Have requested log file - may be Exception in send code.
+ Not enough feedback on Send. (Mats, Nibor).
  Will have more feedback on "Send" confirm message box, including send successful/ fail, cannot spend unconfimed, change still waiting, any errors.

Fees
o Negative fee is accepted. (Nick).   Default fee should be 0.0005 (Nibor).
  Have added test for negative fee.   
  Have added test for fee less than minimum.
  Have set default to 0.0005 BTC
  
UI 
o Use of 3 sig figs in total misleading (Nibor).
  Have changed to show 4 sig figs i.e down to 100 mikes.(approx 0.1 USD cents).

Open Wallet
o Folder can be selected in 'Open Wallet'.   Hangs app. (Nick).
  Can now only select files.   
  Have coded defensively against file being a dir (but should never happen)
o No default file extension on 'Open Wallet' (Nick).
  Have added ".wallet" file filter and added default file on save with file extension of '.wallet'.

Help
o Help page - no feedback whilst loading (Mats).
  Have improved feedback to user whilst loading.   Cursor and little animation in status bar.
   
  
Can be bumped to later releases
+ Network label stays at 'Offline' too long.  Show number of blocks.(Nibor)
  Will add in 'Connecting...' label.   Tooltip/message box/ panel with more network details including number of blocks.
+ Would be nice to drill down to transctions details/ look up in block explorer. (Nibor)
  Agreed.
+ Prioritise encryption. (Nibor).
  Agreed.
+ More flexibility with downloading block chain would be good. (Nibor).
  Agreed.
+ Would be good to have Windows installer. (Nibor).
  Agreed.   Plan to have installers for Win, Mac, Linux.
  

Logging and errors
------------------
+ client does not go offline if you disconnect from network
+ extend log4j logging to all important classes


Outstanding Bugs
----------------
+ if you close the 'open wallet' dialog with the window close button, then reopen it is tiny. (Now only happens sometimes).
+ if you have two multibit open on the same wallet addressbook and wallet can be overwritten one by the other.
  Will add open/ close times to info files and warn user.


Improvements
------------
+ add Swedish (Mats Henricson has volunteered)
+ test it works on the test network
+ ensure switch from test to prod does not confuse which wallet is open. (last test/prod wallet setting ?)
+ add wallet encryption
+ add in more test classes
+ add tests to check sending and receiving works reliably
+ Tidy up github - get rid of extra multibit directory
+ Add in proper jar bundling to exe and DMG - look at ProGuard.   See how Open-Transaction does it.


Patches to Mike
---------------
+ Provide patch with Wallet.java for fees
+ Provide patch with Peer, PeerGroup, Transaction, Transaction?input, Wallet, WalletEventListener for pending transactions
