TODO for minimal viable product
--------------------------------
check sending and receiving works reliably
switching wallets does not clear the address book
make sure right icons are used - no coffee cups
test it works on the test network
ensure all transactions have a transaction date shown - currently pendings don't
after update of address book - need to recreate transactions descriptions
get rid of hardwired peer address - MultiBitService#MultiBitService

Documentation
-------------
write release notes
get the online help to point to a website - put in basic help

Logging and errors
------------------
no error message in MultiBitService#sendCoins when not enough money
no error message when cannot connect to peer
no logging - use log4j

Nice to have
------------
internationalise to Russion
