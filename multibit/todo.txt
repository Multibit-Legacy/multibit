TODO for minimal viable product
--------------------------------
add wallet encryption
add tests to check sending and receiving works reliably
add in support for fees
make sure right icons are used - no coffee cups
test it works on the test network
check switching of wallets hooks up all listeners correctly
ensure switch from test to prod does not confuse which wallet is open. (last test/prod wallet setting ?)
add validation of fields, send: amount, address.   receive address, amount.

Logging and errors
------------------
no error message in MultiBitService#sendCoins when not enough money
no error message when cannot connect to peer
client does not go offline if you disconnect from network
extend log4j logging to all important classes

Outstanding Bugs
----------------

Future enhancements
-------------------
o Add in proper jar bundling to exe and DMG - look at ProGuard
o Improve UI - address can be on main screen rather than a key click away
o Support for subscriptions/ standing orders - add to development plan.
