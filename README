Introduction
============

MultiBit is a lightweight Bitcoin desktop client powered by the BitCoinJ library. 

How to Build MultiBit
=====================

MultiBit use Maven as the build system, so the usual Maven processes apply. If you're not familiar 
with Maven then download it first from http://maven.apache.com and after verifying that it's working,
you're ready. 

Maven build targets
===================
The important targets are:

mvn clean package

which will package the MultiBit project into multibit-x.y.z.jar where x.y.z is the current version
number. This is suitable for local development work.

If you want to generate a complete set of multi-platform installers (Windows, Mac and Linux) you 
use the following command

maven clean install

After some processing, you will have the folowing artifacts in the target directory:

+ an executable jar = multibit-exe.jar
+ a Mac application bundle = MultiBit-x.y.z.app
+ a Mac DMG file = multibit-x.y.z.dmg
+ an installer for Windows = multibit-x.y.z-windows.exe
+ an installer for Linux = multibit-x.y.z-linux.jar

To run MultiBit from these artifacts you can follow the instructions provided on the main MultiBit
website here: http://multibit.org/help.html 

Testnet
=======
To use MultiBit on testNet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" in the file multibit.properties 
to be "test".


Connect to single node
======================
If you want to connect to a single node set the following property in multibit.properties:
singleConnectionNode=<node to connect to>

The node can be specified as either a domain name (www.myNode.com) or an IP address.

Show Merchant Menu
==================
MultiBit works with a sister project called MultiBit Merchant (see https://github.com/gary-rowe/MultiBitMerchant)
which offers specialised features suitable for merchants. To activate these features within the MultiBit client
add the following property into multibit.properties:

showMerchantMenu=true
