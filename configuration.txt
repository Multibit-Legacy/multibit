MultiBit configuration options
==============================

All these options are set in the main control file:
multibit.properties. Multibit looks in a few places for this file:

1. Current working directory when launched. This is for backwards compatibility and for running from a USB drive.

2. (Mac OS X only) Four directory levels up. This is for running from a USB drive, but outside the OSX .app directory.
 
3. The operating system's standard application data directory. 
   - Windows
     * `System.getenv("APPDATA")/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `C:/Documents and Settings/Administrator/Application Data/MultiBit`

   - Mac OS X
     * `System.getProperty("user.home")/Library/Application Support/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `/Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit`

   - Linux:
     * `System.getProperty("user.home")/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `/Users/jim/MultiBit`

Wherever this file is found, that directory is used as the application data directory for Multibit.


Connect to specific peers
-------------------------
If you want to connect to specific peers set the following 
property:

peers=<comma separated list of peers to connect to>

The list of peers can be specified using domain names (www.myNode.com) 
or IP addresses. Example:

peers=173.242.119.177, 176.9.42.247, 217.79.19.226, 98.216.173.54

(The older property singleNodeConnection is still honoured but is
now deprecated. Use 'peers' instead).

Note: ONLY these peers will be used for connections.


Testnet
-------
To use the testnet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
to be "test".
