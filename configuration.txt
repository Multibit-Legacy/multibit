MultiBit configuration options
==============================

All these options are set in the main control file:
multibit.properties. Multibit looks in a few places for this file:

1. Current working directory when launched. This is for backwards compatibility and for running from a USB drive.

2. (Mac OS X only) Four directory levels up. This is for running from a USB drive, but outside the OSX .app directory.
 
3. The operating system's standard application data directory. 
   - Windows
     * `System.getenv("APPDATA")/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `C:/Documents and Settings/Administrator/Application Data/MultiBit`

   - Mac OS X
     * `System.getProperty("user.home")/Library/Application Support/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `/Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit`

   - Linux:
     * `System.getProperty("user.home")/MultiBit`
     * e.g. `/Users/jim/MultiBit`

Wherever this file is found, that directory is used as the application data directory for Multibit.


Connect to single node
----------------------

If you want to connect to a single node, set the following 
property:

```
singleNodeConnection=<node to connect to>
```

The node can be specified as either a domain name (`www.myNode.com`) 
or an IP address. E.g, if your node is `12.34.56.78` you would put:

```
singleNodeConnection=12.34.56.78
```


Testnet
-------------------
To use the testnet set the property "testOrProductionNetwork" 
to be "test".
